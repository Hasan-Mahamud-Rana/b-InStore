A Brief Introduction
====================
Reverie Framework is an extremely versatile HTML5 WordPress framework based on ZURB's [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), a powerful tool for building prototypes on any kind of devices. Reverie follows [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) standard and is [hNews microformat](https://www.readability.com/publishers/guidelines) ready. It is optimized for Search Engine while at the same time improves readability.

It is extremely easy to create your blog, CMS, brochure and any other kind of sites with Reverie. You can see some [samples](http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.php) on ZURB and how they make these prototypes. Did I just mention Reverie works well with [bbPress 2.0](http://bbpress.org/) and [BuddyPress 1.5](http://buddypress.org/)?

###Important###
Please note Reverie 4 was built from groud up (almost), as well as Foundation, thus there is no easy way to upgrade from prior version. Read more about the release on [ThemeFortress](http://themefortress.com/reverie-framework-4/). And start with this version, Reverie will only support the latest and second latest WordPress. Why, [Yoast](http://yoast.com/why-we-dont-support-old-wordpress-versions/) explains it well.

Still, if you want to get Reverie 3 (based on Foundation 3.2), you can find it at our [last Reverie 3 commit](https://github.com/milohuang/reverie/tree/2ef429776d4d3e27906e44d7d0a43cf912078e36).

What about Mobile Devices?
==========================
Positive. With the power of Foundation, Reverie uses media query to adjust for all kinds of devices, including phones, tablets and computers. Reverie is also optimized for iPhone and iPad. Icons and loading images will be display when you save your website as a Home Screen app (example in the above image). Add this page to Home Screen on any iOS devices to see what I mean...
